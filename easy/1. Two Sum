question:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].



solution:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}
        for index, value in enumerate(nums):
            sub = target - value
            if sub in dic:
                return(dic[sub],index)
            else:
                dic[value] = index
  比较简单的对哈希表的应用，也可以用双指针。
